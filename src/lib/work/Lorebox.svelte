<p>Lorcana is a relatively new trading card game, with a wonderful aesthetic and very consistent presentation.  There are a few 3rd party deck builders that exist, but none of them take advantage of that.  I wanted to build something that felt like it fit in with the official&nbsp;product.</p>

<p>Lorebox.ink is a fully featured app, with sorting, filtering, and viewing the entire Lorcana catalog.  You can assemble a deck and keep track of its stats as well as its price.  Sharing is easy with automated deck image generation for social media, a dedicated interactive view mode, or just copying and pasting the dynamically updating&nbsp;url.</p>

<p>Lorebox.ink uses the Lorcast API for card&nbsp;data.</p>
