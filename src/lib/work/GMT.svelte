    <h2><span>Watch Series (GMT)</span></h2>

<p>First in a series of functional illustrations.  I canâ€™t design a real watch, but I can design a virtual one.  A very fun exercise in scale, proportion, and detail.  Creating something that is aesthetically beautiful as well as highly functional and legible.  And then building it in code.</p>

<p>This one is a GMT, or dual time watch, which can track an additional time zone with a 24 hour hand and a rotating outer bezel.</p>
