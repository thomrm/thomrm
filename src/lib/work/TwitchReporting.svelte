    <h2><span>Reporting on Twitch</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The previous iteration of the Twitch report flow was overwhelming. A large number of users who started the report process did not finish it. The flow exposed all available options up front, and there was little consideration for where the report originated. The user path for reporting a live stream and for reporting a chat message started the same way. Along with incompletion, this also contributed to misclassified reports. It placed too much of the burden on the users, as they were not guided to accurate responses, and in turn, added more roadblocks for specialists trying to resolve reports. We wanted to <span class="highlight">build a better reporting process, reducing incompletion rates and increasing report&nbsp;accuracy</span>.</p>

<p>The process for this work followed our usual path. Simplified, we verify the problem, brainstorm solutions, test solutions (prototypes in this case), build, and&nbsp;followup.</p>

    <span class="small">Reporting Step 1.</span>
</div>

<p>Breaking the report flow into several progressive steps made for a less intimidating experience for users. First asking what is being reported, then asking why, and finally asking for more context. Starting the flow from an advanced step when applicable also reduces the number of decisions required. Entering the report flow from a live stream would start with 'Live Stream' already selected as the first&nbsp;step.</p>

    <span class="small">Reporting Step 2.</span>
</div>

<p>For greater report accuracy, we would group relevant reasons with their content types. Presenting smaller and more focused lists of reasons to users to choose from reduces cognitive load. It then becomes easier for users to find and select the most accurate&nbsp;reason.</p>

    <span class="small">Reporting Step 3.</span>
</div>

<p>The changes made to the report flow were successful. Completion rates went up, and accuracy increased. The framework we laid also allowed for rapid iteration, and provided a blueprint for adding new report types and&nbsp;reasons.</p>
